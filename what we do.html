                <p><b>Programmes</b></p>
                <p>We work on a huge range of programmes every year and this work can be divided into three categories of delivery:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In partnership - We deliver impactful collaborative programmes which are funded by corporate partners, trusts and foundations, government and other organisations working with us to further our shared goals.</li>
                    <li>On other's behalf - We undertake commissioned projects involving development work, delivery activities and/or research and insight. We do this with partners, businesses, National Governing Bodies (NGBs) and other organisations who target sporting activity at young people and want to maximise and quantify their impact.</li>
                    <li>Independently - We provide innovative products and services including YST Membership for schools, individuals, NGBs and businesses; training courses including e-learning; and innovative equipment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We have lots of marketing material such as photographs from events.</p>
